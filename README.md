# GitIssueActivity
Activity for practicing with Git branching, GitHub issues and merge requests, and Kanban flow.

For this activity, the students will practice making changes to a GitHub repository. 
The repository has a text file that has been "scrambled" - meaning that random words
have had their characters randomly rearranged, and considered to be issues to be fixed.

The misspellings were generated by the `twiddle.py` program and then entered as issues by the `report.py` program (from this [git-twiddler fork](https://github.com/kwurst/git-twiddler).

## Prereqisites
1. Git installed and configured on your computer.
2. GitHub account created and username emailed to professor.
3. Invitation to class organization on GitHub accepted.
4. SSH key added to GitHub account.

If you have not completed these setup steps, see the instructions at the bottom of this document.

## Set up for In-Class Activity
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
	`git remote add upstream git@github.com:cs-worcester-cs-348-sp-2019/git-issue-activity.git`
	
## Repeat as often as possible during the class:

### 1. Assign yourself to an issue on GitHub (e.g. Issue #42)
1. Go to the project board: [https://github.com/cs-worcester-cs-348-sp-2019/git-issue-activity/projects/1](https://github.com/cs-worcester-cs-348-sp-2019/git-issue-activity/projects/1)
2. Assign yourself to an issue that is unassigned.
3. Move the card from `To Do` to `In Progress`.

### 2. Work on the issue on your computer
1. Make sure you are on the Master branch: `git checkout master` 
2. Pull any changes that have ocurred since your last pull, and correct merge conflicts `git pull upstream master` 
3. Create a branch named for the issue (e.g. `issue-42`), and switch to that branch: `git checkout -b issue-42` 
4. Edit the `LICENSE` file to correct the issue
5. Add the change
6. Commit the change, with a message describing the change (include line number and correction, e.g. `Correct misspelling, line 1: UGN -> GNU` )
7. 	Pull any changes that have ocurred since your last pull, and correct merge conflicts `git pull upstream master` 
8. Push the change `git push origin issue-42`

### 3. Make a pull request on GitHub
1. On GitHub switch to the newly pushed branch.
2. Click the `New Pull Request` button.
3. Include in the pull request text a notation that it closes the assigned issue (e.g. `Closes #42`)
4. Click `Create Pull Request`
5. Wait for the repository owner to accept the pull request.
